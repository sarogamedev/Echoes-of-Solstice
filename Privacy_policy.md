5. Data Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
