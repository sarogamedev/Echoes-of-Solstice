5. Data Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
